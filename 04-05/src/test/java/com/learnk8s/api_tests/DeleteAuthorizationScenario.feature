Feature: Delete authorization

Background:
  * def urlBase = karate.properties['url.base'] || karate.get('urlBase', 'http://localhost:8080')
  * url urlBase
  * def validAuthorizationId = '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'
  * def invalidAuthorizationId = 'invalid-uuid'
  * def authToken = 'Bearer valid-token'
  * def headers = { 'Token': '#(authToken)' }

Scenario: Successfully delete an authorization and confirm it no longer appears in GET request
  # Delete the authorization with a valid ID
  Given path 'authorizations', validAuthorizationId
  And headers headers
  When method delete
  Then status 200
  And match header 'api-version' == '1.0.0'
  # Confirm the authorization has been deleted by checking it does not appear in GET request
  Given path 'authorizations'
  And headers headers
  When method get
  Then status 200
  And match header 'api-version' == '1.0.0'
  And match each response.authorizations[*].id != validAuthorizationId

Scenario: Attempt to delete an authorization with an invalid ID and confirm error response
  # Attempt to delete the authorization with an invalid ID
  Given path 'authorizations', invalidAuthorizationId
  And headers headers
  When method delete
  Then status 400
  And match header 'api-version' == '1.0.0'
  # Confirm the error response does not affect the existing authorizations
  Given path 'authorizations'
  And headers headers
  When method get
  Then status 200
  And match header 'api-version' == '1.0.0'
  And assert response.authorizations.size() > 0
