Scenario 1: Description field is set with a non-empty string

Details:
  TestName: toStringReturnsNonEmptyDescription
  Description: This test verifies that the toString method returns the exact string that is set in the description field of the object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the description field to a non-empty string.
    Act: Invoke the toString method on the created instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned string from toString matches the non-empty string set in the description field.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the toString method correctly returns the value of the description field. This is important to ensure that the object can represent itself as a string accurately, which can be critical for logging or displaying information to the user.

Scenario 2: Description field is null

Details:
  TestName: toStringHandlesNullDescription
  Description: This test checks if the toString method can handle a null value in the description field without throwing an exception.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting the description field, leaving it null.
    Act: Invoke the toString method on the created instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned string from toString is null or the expected string representation of null.
  Validation:
    The assertion ensures that the toString method gracefully handles null values. This is significant because it prevents the application from crashing due to a null pointer exception when attempting to represent the object as a string.

Scenario 3: Description field is an empty string

Details:
  TestName: toStringReturnsEmptyDescription
  Description: This test ensures that the toString method returns an empty string when the description field is set to an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the description field to an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the toString method on the created instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned string from toString is an empty string.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks that the toString method accurately reflects an empty description field. This is essential to confirm that the object's string representation is consistent with its state.

Scenario 4: Description field contains special characters

Details:
  TestName: toStringReturnsDescriptionWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test verifies that the toString method accurately returns a description containing special characters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the description field to a string with special characters.
    Act: Invoke the toString method on the created instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned string from toString matches the string with special characters.
  Validation:
    The assertion ensures that the toString method can handle strings with special characters without altering them. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity when the description contains special symbols or formatting that must be preserved.

Scenario 5: Object is a MongoDB document

Details:
  TestName: toStringReflectsMongoDbDocument
  Description: This test checks that the toString method's output is consistent for an instance that is also a MongoDB document, as indicated by the class-level annotations.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class annotated as a MongoDB document and set the description field to a valid string.
    Act: Invoke the toString method on the created instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned string from toString matches the string set in the description field.
  Validation:
    The assertion confirms that the toString method works as expected, even for objects that are meant to be persisted in MongoDB. This is important for debugging and logging purposes, especially when dealing with database operations.

Scenario 6: Object is constructed using all-args constructor

Details:
  TestName: toStringAfterUsingAllArgsConstructor
  Description: This test verifies that the toString method returns the correct description after the object is constructed using the all-args constructor provided by Lombok.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Use the all-args constructor to create an instance of the class with a specific description.
    Act: Invoke the toString method on the created instance.
    Assert: Assert that the returned string from toString matches the description set through the constructor.
  Validation:
    The assertion ensures that the all-args constructor properly initializes the description field and that the toString method can reflect this initialization. This is essential for validating that Lombok-generated constructors are working as intended.
