```
Scenario 1: toString method with non-null description

Details:
  TestName: toStringReturnsValidDescription
  Description: This test ensures that the toString method correctly returns the description when it is not null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a non-null description.
  Act: Call the toString method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value equals the description that was set during the arrangement.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the toString method returns the exact description string that was initialized in the object. This is significant because it confirms the method's ability to accurately represent the state of the object in string form.

Scenario 2: toString method with null description

Details:
  TestName: toStringHandlesNullDescription
  Description: This test checks whether the toString method can handle a null description gracefully, potentially returning null or a default string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting the description field (leaving it null).
  Act: Call the toString method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is either null or a predefined string expected for null descriptions.
Validation:
  This assertion confirms that the toString method is robust and can handle null states without throwing an exception. This is important for ensuring the method's reliability when the object's state is incomplete.

Scenario 3: toString method after modifying the description

Details:
  TestName: toStringReflectsUpdatedDescription
  Description: This test ensures that if the description field is updated after the object's creation, the toString method reflects the new value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with an initial description, then update the description to a new value.
  Act: Call the toString method after the update.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the updated description.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the toString method accurately reflects the current state of the description field. This is crucial for confirming that the method remains consistent with the object's state throughout its lifecycle.

Scenario 4: toString method behavior in a persisted entity

Details:
  TestName: toStringWithPersistedEntity
  Description: This test verifies the toString method's behavior for an entity that has been persisted, ensuring the method is unaffected by the persistence mechanisms (e.g., MongoDB's @Id annotation).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a non-null description and simulate the entity's persistence by setting an ID value.
  Act: Call the toString method on the persisted instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value equals the description and that the persistence state does not affect the output.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the toString method's behavior is consistent regardless of whether the entity is transient or persisted. This is important for ensuring that the method's output is reliable in different states of the entity's lifecycle.

Scenario 5: toString method with special characters in description

Details:
  TestName: toStringHandlesSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test ensures that the toString method correctly handles descriptions containing special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with a description that includes special characters (e.g., newline, tab, unicode).
  Act: Call the toString method on the instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value accurately represents the special characters in the description.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the toString method can handle strings with special characters, ensuring that the method is robust and can accurately represent the object's description in various scenarios.
