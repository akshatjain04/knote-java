To validate the business logic of the `addResourceHandlers` method in the provided code snippet, you would need to create a set of test scenarios that ensure the method is functioning correctly and handling resources as expected. Here are some potential test scenarios:

1. **Resource Handler Registration**: Test that the resource handler for the path pattern "/uploads/**" is correctly registered within the `ResourceHandlerRegistry`.

2. **Resource Location Configuration**: Test that the resource location is set to the correct directory as provided by `properties.getUploadDir()` and that it correctly uses the `file:` protocol.

3. **Cache Configuration**: Test that the cache period for static resources is set to 3600 seconds (1 hour) as specified by the `.setCachePeriod(3600)` method call.

4. **Resource Chain Activation**: Test that the resource chain is enabled by checking if `.resourceChain(true)` is effectively turning on the optimization for resource serving.

5. **Path Resource Resolver**: Test that a `PathResourceResolver` is added to the resource chain, and ensure that it's correctly resolving paths as intended.

6. **Invalid Resource Access**: Test the behavior when attempting to access a resource that does not exist within the specified upload directory.

7. **Directory Traversal Security**: Test that the resource handler is secure against directory traversal attacks by attempting to access files outside the intended directory using relative paths (e.g., using "../" in the URL).

8. **Proper MIME Types**: Test that the resources served have the correct MIME types set in the response headers.

9. **Cache Headers**: Test that appropriate cache headers are sent in the response, indicating that the resource can be cached for 3600 seconds.

10. **Resource Modification**: Test the behavior when a resource in the upload directory is modified. Ensure that the updated resource is served if the cache has expired or the cache is invalidated.

11. **Resource Deletion**: Test the behavior when a resource is deleted from the upload directory. The server should no longer serve the deleted resource.

12. **Concurrent Access**: Simulate multiple concurrent requests to the same resource to ensure that the resource handler can handle concurrent loads without issues.

13. **Large File Handling**: Test the handling of large files to ensure that the resource handler can serve large resources without running into memory issues or timeouts.

14. **Resource Overwriting**: Test what happens when a resource is overwritten by another with the same name. Ensure the new resource is served instead of the cached old one after the cache period expires.

15. **Properties Reload**: If the system allows for dynamic reloading of properties, test that updating the `properties.getUploadDir()` value at runtime correctly changes the resource location without requiring an application restart.

Remember, for each test scenario, you would need to verify both the expected behavior (positive testing) and how the system handles unexpected or erroneous inputs (negative testing).
