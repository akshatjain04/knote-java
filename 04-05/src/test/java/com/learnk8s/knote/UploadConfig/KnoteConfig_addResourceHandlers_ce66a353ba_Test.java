================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-22: Path Traversal
Issue: Using user input to construct file paths without proper validation can lead to path traversal attacks, allowing attackers to access or modify files outside of the intended directory.
Solution: Validate or sanitize the file paths to ensure they do not contain '..' sequences or other unexpected characters. Use secure methods to combine paths, such as `Paths.get()` or `FileSystems.getDefault().getPath()`.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The application may expose sensitive files through '/uploads/' endpoint with read permissions to unauthorized users, leading to information disclosure.
Solution: Set appropriate file permissions for the uploaded files and restrict access to authorized users only. Implement proper authentication and authorization checks before serving the files.

Vulnerability: CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
Issue: If the application allows uploading of arbitrary files without proper validation, it might be possible for an attacker to upload malicious files that can compromise the server or be served to other users.
Solution: Implement file type validation on the server-side to ensure only permitted types of files are uploaded. Additionally, perform antivirus checks on uploaded files.

Vulnerability: CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
Issue: Serving files without ensuring their integrity can lead to the serving of tampered files if an attacker gains write access to the upload directory.
Solution: Implement checksum verification or digital signatures to ensure the integrity of the files before they are served to the client.

Vulnerability: CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
Issue: Without proper session handling, an attacker might exploit stale sessions to gain unauthorized access to the application.
Solution: Enforce session expiration and provide users with the ability to manually terminate their sessions. Utilize secure session management practices.

Here are some test scenarios to validate the business logic of the `addResourceHandlers` method:

1. **Resource Handler Registration**: Verify that a resource handler for the path `/uploads/**` is correctly registered with the `ResourceHandlerRegistry`.

2. **Resource Location Configuration**: Check that the resource handler is configured with the correct resource location, which should be the upload directory specified by `properties.getUploadDir()`.

3. **Cache Period Verification**: Ensure that the cache period for the resources served by the handler is set to 3600 seconds (1 hour), as specified in the `.setCachePeriod(3600)` method call.

4. **Resource Chain Activation**: Confirm that the resource chain is enabled for the resource handler, which is indicated by the `.resourceChain(true)` method call.

5. **Path Resource Resolver Addition**: Validate that a `PathResourceResolver` is added to the resource handler's resolver chain.

6. **Upload Directory Existence**: Test that the directory specified by `properties.getUploadDir()` actually exists on the filesystem and is accessible.

7. **Resource Serving**: Attempt to access a known resource in the `/uploads/` directory via a web request and verify that it is served correctly.

8. **Cache Behavior**: Test the caching behavior by requesting a resource multiple times and ensuring that subsequent requests within the cache period do not result in the resource being reloaded from the disk.

9. **Invalid Path Handling**: Request a resource that does not exist under the specified upload directory and confirm that the server responds appropriately, such as returning a 404 Not Found status.

10. **Directory Traversal Security**: Ensure that the resource handler does not allow directory traversal attacks by attempting to request resources using paths like `/uploads/../etc/passwd` or other paths that should be outside the scope of the upload directory.

11. **File Type Restrictions**: If there are any implicit or explicit restrictions on the types of files that can be served (e.g., only images), verify that these restrictions are enforced.

12. **Overriding Properties**: Test the behavior when `properties.getUploadDir()` is changed to a new value, to ensure that the resource handler picks up the new directory path.

13. **Concurrency Handling**: Simulate multiple, concurrent requests to the resource handler to verify that it handles load properly and serves resources without deadlocks or race conditions.

14. **Error Handling**: Introduce errors, such as setting an invalid directory path or removing permissions for the upload directory, and verify that the application handles these errors gracefully.

15. **Performance Metrics**: Measure the response times and resource utilization when serving files from the upload directory to ensure that the performance is acceptable and meets any defined SLAs.

These test scenarios cover a range of functional and non-functional aspects of the `addResourceHandlers` method. They will help ensure that the method is correctly implemented and behaves as expected in various conditions.
