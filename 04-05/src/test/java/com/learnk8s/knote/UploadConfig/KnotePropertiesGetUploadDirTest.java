```
Scenario 1: Verify that getUploadDir returns the correct upload directory when it is set

Details:
  TestName: shouldReturnCurrentUploadDir
  Description: This test verifies that the getUploadDir method returns the correct String value for the uploadDir when it has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the value of the private String uploadDir using reflection or a public setter if available.
  Act: Call the getUploadDir method to retrieve the value of uploadDir.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the value set during the Arrange step.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the getUploadDir method correctly retrieves the value of the uploadDir field. This is significant as it ensures that the application can correctly provide the upload directory information when requested.

Scenario 2: Verify that getUploadDir returns null when the upload directory is not set

Details:
  TestName: shouldReturnNullWhenUploadDirNotSet
  Description: This test checks that the getUploadDir method returns null when the uploadDir has not been initialized or set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not set a value for the private String uploadDir; it should be null by default.
  Act: Call the getUploadDir method to retrieve the value of uploadDir.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the getUploadDir method correctly handles the scenario where the uploadDir is not set. This is important for the application to handle cases where the upload directory might not be configured.

Scenario 3: Verify that getUploadDir returns the value injected by Spring when using @Value annotation

Details:
  TestName: shouldReturnInjectedValueBySpring
  Description: This test ensures that the getUploadDir method returns the value that is injected by Spring's @Value annotation at runtime.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Spring environment to inject a test value for the uploadDir using the @Value annotation.
  Act: Call the getUploadDir method to retrieve the value of uploadDir.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the mock value injected by Spring.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the getUploadDir method is compatible with Spring's dependency injection mechanism. This is crucial for ensuring that configuration properties are correctly loaded and used within the application.

Scenario 4: Verify that getUploadDir reflects changes after updating uploadDir through a configuration update

Details:
  TestName: shouldReflectUpdatedValueAfterConfigurationChange
  Description: This test confirms that the getUploadDir method returns the updated value after the uploadDir has been changed through a configuration update.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate a configuration change that updates the value of the private String uploadDir.
  Act: Call the getUploadDir method to retrieve the new value of uploadDir.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the updated configuration value.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the getUploadDir method reflects changes to the uploadDir field when the configuration is updated at runtime. This is important for dynamic configuration scenarios where the upload directory might need to be changed without restarting the application.
