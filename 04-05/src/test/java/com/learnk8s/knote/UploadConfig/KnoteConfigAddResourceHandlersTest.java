Scenario 1: Successful Resource Handler Registration

Details:
  TestName: ensureResourceHandlerIsAddedCorrectly
  Description: This test ensures that the resource handler is successfully added to the registry with the correct path pattern, resource location, cache period, and resource chain configuration.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ResourceHandlerRegistry and KnoteProperties, and set the expected upload directory in the properties.
  Act: Call the addResourceHandlers method with the mocked registry.
  Assert: Verify that the addResourceHandler method is called on the registry with the correct arguments ("/uploads/**"), that addResourceLocations is called with the "file:" prefix concatenated with the upload directory from properties, that setCachePeriod is set to 3600, and that the resource chain is enabled with a PathResourceResolver added.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the method configures the resource handler with the expected settings. The significance of the test is to ensure that uploaded files are served correctly with caching and proper resolution.

Scenario 2: Null ResourceHandlerRegistry Provided

Details:
  TestName: ensureNullRegistryHandledGracefully
  Description: This test checks whether the method handles a null ResourceHandlerRegistry without throwing an exception, which would indicate robust error handling.
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass a null ResourceHandlerRegistry to the method.
  Act: Call the addResourceHandlers method with the null registry.
  Assert: Expect no exceptions to be thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method can handle null input for the registry gracefully. This is significant for avoiding runtime exceptions that could crash the application if the registry isn't initialized properly.

Scenario 3: KnoteProperties Upload Directory Not Set

Details:
  TestName: ensureHandlingOfMissingUploadDir
  Description: This test ensures that the method handles the case where the upload directory in KnoteProperties is not set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ResourceHandlerRegistry and KnoteProperties without setting an upload directory.
  Act: Call the addResourceHandlers method with the mocked registry.
  Assert: Verify that the addResourceLocations method is called with a fallback or default path if the upload directory is null or empty.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method provides a default configuration when the upload directory is not specified. This is significant for the application's resilience, ensuring that it can still serve resources even if the configuration is incomplete.

Scenario 4: ResourceHandlerRegistry Throws Exception

Details:
  TestName: ensureExceptionFromRegistryIsHandled
  Description: This test ensures that the method handles any exceptions thrown by the ResourceHandlerRegistry when adding a resource handler.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ResourceHandlerRegistry to throw an exception when addResourceHandler is called.
  Act: Call the addResourceHandlers method with the mocked registry.
  Assert: Expect the method to catch and handle the exception appropriately, possibly logging the error.
Validation:
  This assertion checks that the method is resilient to failures within the ResourceHandlerRegistry. It is important for the application's stability, preventing a single point of failure from cascading to other parts of the system.

Scenario 5: Invalid Resource Location Path

Details:
  TestName: ensureInvalidResourceLocationIsHandled
  Description: This test checks whether the method handles an invalid resource location path gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ResourceHandlerRegistry and set an invalid path in the KnoteProperties upload directory (e.g., a path with illegal characters or a protocol not supported by the resource handler).
  Act: Call the addResourceHandlers method with the mocked registry.
  Assert: Verify that the method handles the invalid path scenario, either by defaulting to a valid path or by logging an error without throwing an exception.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the application does not crash or become unstable due to an invalid resource location path. It highlights the importance of validating external configurations that might affect application behavior.
