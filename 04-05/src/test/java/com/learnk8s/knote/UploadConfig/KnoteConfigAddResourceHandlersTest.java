Scenario 1: Successful Resource Handler Registration

Details:
  TestName: ensureResourceHandlerIsAddedCorrectly
  Description: This test checks if the resource handler for "/uploads/**" is successfully added with the correct resource location, cache period, and resource resolver.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ResourceHandlerRegistry and KnoteProperties objects. Set up the expected upload directory in KnoteProperties.
  Act: Call the addResourceHandlers method with the mocked ResourceHandlerRegistry.
  Assert: Verify that the addResourceHandler method is called with "/uploads/**" as the pattern, that addResourceLocations is called with the "file:" prefix concatenated with the upload directory from KnoteProperties, that setCachePeriod is called with 3600, and that addResolver is called with an instance of PathResourceResolver.
Validation:
  Clarifying that the resource handler is configured correctly ensures that uploaded files are served with appropriate caching and resolution. This is crucial for performance and correct behavior of the file serving mechanism within the application.

Scenario 2: Upload Directory Is Configured Incorrectly

Details:
  TestName: ensureResourceHandlerFailsGracefullyWhenUploadDirIsIncorrect
  Description: This test verifies that the resource handler configuration handles the scenario where the upload directory is set incorrectly (e.g., it's null or an invalid path).
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ResourceHandlerRegistry and KnoteProperties objects. Configure KnoteProperties to return an invalid upload directory path.
  Act: Call the addResourceHandlers method with the mocked ResourceHandlerRegistry.
  Assert: Verify that the application does not throw an unexpected exception and handles the misconfiguration appropriately, possibly by not adding the resource handler or logging the error.
Validation:
  Ensuring that the application can handle configuration errors without crashing is important for robustness. This test checks the application's resilience to misconfigurations in the properties.

Scenario 3: Cache Period Configuration Is Customizable

Details:
  TestName: ensureCachePeriodIsConfigurable
  Description: This test ensures that the cache period for the resource handler can be set from a configuration property rather than being hardcoded.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ResourceHandlerRegistry and KnoteProperties objects. Set up a customizable cache period in KnoteProperties.
  Act: Call the addResourceHandlers method with the mocked ResourceHandlerRegistry.
  Assert: Verify that setCachePeriod is called with the cache period value obtained from KnoteProperties.
Validation:
  This test validates that the cache period is not hardcoded and can be customized through properties, which allows for flexibility and adaptability to different deployment environments.

Scenario 4: Resource Chain Enabled Configuration

Details:
  TestName: ensureResourceChainIsEnabled
  Description: This test ensures that the resource chain is enabled when adding a resource handler.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ResourceHandlerRegistry object.
  Act: Call the addResourceHandlers method with the mocked ResourceHandlerRegistry.
  Assert: Verify that the resourceChain(true) method is called, indicating that the resource chain is enabled.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the resource chain is enabled, which is important for performance as it allows for efficient resolution and transformation of resources. This test ensures that the configuration is set as expected for optimal performance.

Scenario 5: PathResourceResolver Is Added Correctly

Details:
  TestName: ensurePathResourceResolverIsAdded
  Description: This test checks that the PathResourceResolver is added to the resource handler.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ResourceHandlerRegistry object.
  Act: Call the addResourceHandlers method with the mocked ResourceHandlerRegistry.
  Assert: Verify that addResolver is called with an instance of PathResourceResolver.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the PathResourceResolver is correctly added to the resource handler chain, which is necessary for resolving static resources based on the request path, ensuring correct application behavior.
