Scenario 1: Successful Resource Handler Registration

Details:
  TestName: ensureResourceHandlerIsAddedCorrectly
  Description: This test ensures that the resource handler is successfully registered with the correct path pattern, resource location, cache period, and resource chain configuration.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ResourceHandlerRegistry and KnoteProperties objects. Set the upload directory in the KnoteProperties mock.
  Act: Invoke the addResourceHandlers method with the mocked ResourceHandlerRegistry.
  Assert: Verify that the addResourceHandler method is called with the path pattern "/uploads/**", and that the addResourceLocations, setCachePeriod, resourceChain, and addResolver methods are called with the appropriate arguments.
Validation:
  Clarify that the resource handler is correctly configured to serve files from the specified upload directory with caching and a resource chain in place. This is crucial for serving static resources efficiently.

Scenario 2: KnoteProperties UploadDir is Null

Details:
  TestName: ensureResourceHandlerHandlesNullUploadDir
  Description: This test checks if the resource handler behaves correctly when the upload directory in KnoteProperties is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ResourceHandlerRegistry and create an instance of KnoteProperties with a null upload directory.
  Act: Invoke the addResourceHandlers method with the mocked ResourceHandlerRegistry.
  Assert: Verify that the addResourceHandler method is not called or that it throws an appropriate exception, depending on the expected behavior when the upload directory is null.
Validation:
  Clarify that the system gracefully handles the case when the upload directory is not configured. This test ensures the robustness of the application in handling misconfigurations.

Scenario 3: Resource Chain Disabled

Details:
  TestName: ensureResourceHandlerWithResourceChainDisabled
  Description: This test verifies that the resource handler is correctly configured when the resource chain is set to false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ResourceHandlerRegistry and KnoteProperties. Set the upload directory and explicitly set the resource chain to false.
  Act: Invoke the addResourceHandlers method with the mocked ResourceHandlerRegistry.
  Assert: Verify that the resourceChain method is called with the argument false and that the addResolver method is not called.
Validation:
  Clarify that the resource handler is correctly configured without a resource chain. This is important for applications that do not require on-the-fly resource resolution.

Scenario 4: Invalid Resource Location

Details:
  TestName: ensureResourceHandlerHandlesInvalidResourceLocation
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the resource handler when provided with an invalid resource location.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ResourceHandlerRegistry and KnoteProperties. Set the upload directory to an invalid path.
  Act: Invoke the addResourceHandlers method with the mocked ResourceHandlerRegistry.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate exception is thrown or an error is logged.
Validation:
  Clarify that the system is capable of identifying and handling invalid resource locations. This test ensures that the application does not fail silently and provides feedback for misconfigurations.

Scenario 5: Resource Cache Period Set to Zero

Details:
  TestName: ensureResourceHandlerHandlesZeroCachePeriod
  Description: This test ensures that the resource handler is configured correctly when the cache period is set to zero, implying no caching.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ResourceHandlerRegistry and KnoteProperties. Set the upload directory and cache period to zero.
  Act: Invoke the addResourceHandlers method with the mocked ResourceHandlerRegistry.
  Assert: Verify that the setCachePeriod method is called with the argument zero.
Validation:
  Clarify that the resource handler is configured to not cache resources when the cache period is zero. This is essential for ensuring that resources are always fetched from the server, which is useful in development environments or when caching is not desired.

	// Additional comment regarding the removed test cases:
	// As per the current implementation of the KnoteConfig's addResourceHandlers method,
	// there are some hardcoded values
	// such as the cache period and the fact that the resource chain is always enabled
	// with a PathResourceResolver.
	// If there is a requirement to make these configurable, then the business logic
	// should be enhanced to allow such configuration.
	// Otherwise, the removed test cases are not applicable as the current business logic
	// does not support those scenarios.
