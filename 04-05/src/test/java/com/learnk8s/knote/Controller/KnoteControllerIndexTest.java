Scenario 1: Successful retrieval of notes

Details:
  TestName: testIndexShouldReturnListOfNotes
  Description: This test ensures that the index method returns a list of Note objects wrapped in a ResponseEntity with an OK status when the operation is successful.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the NotesRepository to return a list of Note objects when getAllNotes is called. Initialize the model to be passed to the index method.
  Act: Call the index method with the mocked model.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a status code of OK (HttpStatus.OK) and that the body contains the expected list of Note objects.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the HTTP status is 200 OK and the body contains the correct data. This is significant as it confirms the method behaves correctly when the repository successfully retrieves notes.

Scenario 2: Notes list is empty

Details:
  TestName: testIndexShouldReturnEmptyListWhenNoNotes
  Description: This test verifies that the index method returns an empty list of Note objects wrapped in a ResponseEntity with an OK status when there are no notes available.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the NotesRepository to return an empty list when getAllNotes is called. Initialize the model to be passed to the index method.
  Act: Call the index method with the mocked model.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a status code of OK (HttpStatus.OK) and that the body is an empty list.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the HTTP status is 200 OK and the body is an empty list, which is important to confirm that the method handles the case of no available notes correctly.

Scenario 3: NotesRepository throws an exception

Details:
  TestName: testIndexShouldHandleRepositoryException
  Description: This test checks that the index method handles exceptions thrown by the NotesRepository gracefully and returns an appropriate ResponseEntity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the NotesRepository to throw a RuntimeException when getAllNotes is called. Initialize the model to be passed to the index method.
  Act: Call the index method and expect an exception.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a status code of INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR (HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the method responds with a 500 Internal Server Error status code when an exception occurs, which is essential to handle unexpected errors gracefully and inform the client accordingly.

Scenario 4: Model attribute is required but missing

Details:
  TestName: testIndexShouldHandleMissingModelAttribute
  Description: Verify that the index method responds with an appropriate error when the required model attribute is missing.
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass a null or improperly initialized model to the index method.
  Act: Call the index method with the null or improperly initialized model.
  Assert: Expect the method to throw a specific exception related to missing model attributes, such as ModelAttributeMissingException.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for the presence of a ModelAttributeMissingException, ensuring that the method properly detects and reports the absence of required model attributes. This is vital for maintaining contract integrity between the controller and the view.

Note: The last scenario assumes the existence of a custom exception called ModelAttributeMissingException, which is not part of the standard Java or Spring libraries. If such an exception does not exist, the scenario may need to be adjusted according to the actual behavior of the index method when model attributes are missing.
