Scenario 1: Successful retrieval of notes

Details:
  TestName: shouldRetrieveAllNotesSuccessfully
  Description: This test ensures that the index method retrieves all notes successfully and returns them in the ResponseEntity with an OK status.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the Model and NotesRepository to return a predefined list of Note objects when getAllNotes is called.
    Act: Invoke the index method with the mocked Model.
    Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity contains the list of Note objects and that the status is HttpStatus.OK.
  Validation:
    Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. The test validates that the index method correctly retrieves notes from the repository and wraps them in a ResponseEntity with the correct status code, reflecting the expected behavior of the application when the notes are successfully fetched.
    Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. The test ensures that the application can successfully display all notes to the user.

Scenario 2: Empty list of notes

Details:
  TestName: shouldHandleEmptyListOfNotes
  Description: This test checks if the index method handles the scenario where there are no notes to retrieve, returning an empty list within the ResponseEntity.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the Model and NotesRepository to return an empty list when getAllNotes is called.
    Act: Invoke the index method with the mocked Model.
    Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity contains an empty list and that the status is HttpStatus.OK.
  Validation:
    Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. The assertion verifies that the index method can handle the case where no notes are available and still returns an appropriate response without errors. It confirms that the application can gracefully handle an empty state.
    Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. This test is crucial to ensure that the user interface can reflect an empty notes state without crashing or showing incorrect information.

Scenario 3: Model attribute not present

Details:
  TestName: shouldHandleMissingModelAttribute
  Description: This test is to ensure that the index method behaves correctly when the Model attribute required by getAllNotes is not present.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the Model without the required attribute.
    Act: Invoke the index method with the incomplete Model.
    Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown or an error ResponseEntity to be returned.
  Validation:
    Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. The assertion checks that the index method fails gracefully by providing an informative response or exception when required attributes are missing from the Model.
    Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. This test ensures that the application handles incomplete or incorrect data scenarios without unexpected behavior, which is essential for robustness and reliability.

Scenario 4: NotesRepository throws exception

Details:
  TestName: shouldHandleRepositoryException
  Description: This test verifies that the index method can handle situations where the NotesRepository throws an exception during the retrieval of notes.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the Model and NotesRepository to throw a runtime exception when getAllNotes is called.
    Act: Invoke the index method with the mocked Model.
    Assert: Verify that an appropriate error handling mechanism is triggered, such as returning an error ResponseEntity or logging the exception.
  Validation:
    Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. The assertion confirms that the index method has error handling in place for unexpected exceptions from the NotesRepository, ensuring application stability and user feedback.
    Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. This test ensures that the application is resilient to failures in the data access layer and can communicate issues effectively to the user or system administrator.
