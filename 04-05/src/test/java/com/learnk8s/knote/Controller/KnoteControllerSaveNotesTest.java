ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=saveNotes_584e2e5550

Scenario 1: Valid Upload Request

Details:
  TestName: testValidUploadRequest
  Description: This test ensures that when a valid file and 'Upload' parameter are provided, the uploadImage method is called, and a CREATED status is returned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile to have a valid original filename. Set 'upload' parameter to "Upload".
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with the mock file, a valid description, the 'upload' parameter, and a mock Model.
  Assert: Verify that ResponseEntity contains HttpStatus.CREATED.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that when a valid upload request is made, the method should process the request and return a CREATED status. It validates the correct flow of uploading an image.

Scenario 2: Missing File in Upload Request

Details:
  TestName: testMissingFileInUploadRequest
  Description: This test checks the method's response when the file parameter is missing or has an empty original filename while the 'Upload' parameter is set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile to have an empty original filename. Set 'upload' parameter to "Upload".
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with the mock file, a valid description, the 'upload' parameter, and a mock Model.
  Assert: Verify that ResponseEntity contains HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to ensure that the method returns BAD_REQUEST when a file parameter is missing or invalid. This test is significant for validating input data integrity and error handling.

Scenario 3: Valid Publish Request

Details:
  TestName: testValidPublishRequest
  Description: This test ensures that when a valid description and 'Publish' parameter are provided, the saveNote method is called, and a CREATED status is returned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set 'publish' parameter to "Publish".
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with a valid description, the 'publish' parameter, and a mock Model.
  Assert: Verify that ResponseEntity contains HttpStatus.CREATED.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that a valid publish request leads to a successful note saving and a CREATED status in response. It validates the publish functionality.

Scenario 4: Both Upload and Publish Parameters Missing

Details:
  TestName: testBothUploadAndPublishParametersMissing
  Description: This test checks the response when both 'upload' and 'publish' parameters are missing.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not set 'upload' or 'publish' parameters.
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with a valid description and a mock Model.
  Assert: Verify that ResponseEntity contains HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method returns BAD_REQUEST when neither 'upload' nor 'publish' options are chosen. This test is significant for ensuring that the method enforces the requirement of choosing an action.

Scenario 5: Invalid Upload and Publish Parameters

Details:
  TestName: testInvalidUploadAndPublishParameters
  Description: This test verifies the response when 'upload' and 'publish' parameters are provided with values other than "Upload" and "Publish" respectively.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set 'upload' and 'publish' parameters to invalid values.
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with a valid description, both invalid parameters, and a mock Model.
  Assert: Verify that ResponseEntity contains HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method handles invalid values for 'upload' and 'publish' parameters properly by returning BAD_REQUEST. It ensures the method validates parameter values correctly.

Scenario 6: Both Upload and Publish Parameters Provided

Details:
  TestName: testBothUploadAndPublishParametersProvided
  Description: This test ensures the method's response when both 'upload' and 'publish' parameters are provided correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile to have a valid original filename. Set 'upload' parameter to "Upload" and 'publish' parameter to "Publish".
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with the mock file, a valid description, both parameters, and a mock Model.
  Assert: Verify the behavior of the method (it should either upload or publish but not both, depending on the implementation logic).
Validation:
  The assertion verifies the expected outcome when both actions are requested. It's significant for validating the method's decision-making logic in handling conflicting parameters.

Scenario 7: File Upload Exception Handling

Details:
  TestName: testFileUploadExceptionHandling
  Description: This test checks how the method handles exceptions during file upload.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile to throw an exception when getting the original filename. Set 'upload' parameter to "Upload".
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with the mock file, a valid description, the 'upload' parameter, and a mock Model, expecting an exception.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate exception is thrown or handled.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method gracefully handles exceptions during file upload. It's critical for ensuring robustness and stability of the application in the face of errors during file operations.

Please note that actual implementation of tests would require mocking dependencies such as `MultipartFile`, `Model`, and possibly the methods `uploadImage`, `saveNote`, and repository interactions, which are implied but not explicitly detailed in the scenarios above.
