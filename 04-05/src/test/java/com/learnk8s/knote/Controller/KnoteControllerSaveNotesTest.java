Scenario 1: Valid Upload Without Publish

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithValidUpload
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly handles the scenario where a valid file upload request is made without a publish request.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile to simulate a valid file upload. Set 'upload' parameter to "Upload" and 'publish' parameter to null.
  Act: Call the saveNotes method with the mocked file, a valid description, null publish parameter, and a dummy Model object.
  Assert: Assert that the response entity's status code is HttpStatus.CREATED.
Validation:
  Validate that when a valid file is uploaded without a publish request, the method should process the upload successfully and return a CREATED status. This test ensures that the upload functionality works as expected.

Scenario 2: Invalid File Upload Attempt

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithInvalidFile
  Description: This test verifies that the method returns a BAD_REQUEST status when an invalid or empty file is uploaded.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile to simulate an invalid file (e.g., with an empty original filename). Set 'upload' parameter to "Upload".
  Act: Call the saveNotes method with the mocked invalid file, a valid description, null publish parameter, and a dummy Model object.
  Assert: Assert that the response entity's status code is HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  Validate that the method rejects invalid file uploads by returning a BAD_REQUEST status. This test ensures the robustness of the file validation logic.

Scenario 3: Valid Publish Without Upload

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithValidPublish
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly handles the scenario where a valid publish request is made without an upload request.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set 'publish' parameter to "Publish" and 'upload' parameter to null, with a valid description and a dummy Model object.
  Act: Call the saveNotes method with null file, a valid description, the publish parameter set to "Publish", and a dummy Model object.
  Assert: Assert that the response entity's status code is HttpStatus.CREATED.
Validation:
  Validate that when a valid publish request is made without an upload, the method should save the note and return a CREATED status. This test confirms that the publish functionality is working as intended.

Scenario 4: Neither Upload Nor Publish Specified

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithoutUploadOrPublish
  Description: This test ensures that the method returns a BAD_REQUEST status when neither upload nor publish parameters are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set both 'upload' and 'publish' parameters to null, with a valid description and a dummy Model object.
  Act: Call the saveNotes method with a null file, a valid description, null upload and publish parameters, and a dummy Model object.
  Assert: Assert that the response entity's status code is HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  Validate that the method enforces the rule that either an upload or publish operation must be specified. The test checks that the method does not proceed with any operation and correctly returns a BAD_REQUEST status in such a case.

Scenario 5: Both Upload and Publish Specified

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithBothUploadAndPublish
  Description: This test verifies the method's behavior when both upload and publish parameters are provided, which is not a valid scenario according to the method's logic.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile to simulate a valid file upload. Set both 'upload' and 'publish' parameters to their respective valid values ("Upload" and "Publish"), with a valid description and a dummy Model object.
  Act: Call the saveNotes method with the mocked file, a valid description, both upload and publish parameters set, and a dummy Model object.
  Assert: The expected behavior is not defined in the provided method; thus, the test should clarify what the expected outcome should be.
Validation:
  This scenario is ambiguous as the method does not explicitly handle the case when both upload and publish are provided. The test would highlight this gap and could lead to further clarification or method refactoring to handle such a scenario properly.
