Scenario 1: Missing both upload and publish parameters

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithNoActionSelected
  Description: This test checks the scenario where both 'upload' and 'publish' parameters are missing, which should result in a BAD_REQUEST response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock MultipartFile and a mock Model.
  Act: Call saveNotes with null 'upload' and 'publish' parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the response entity has a status of HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method correctly handles the absence of action parameters by returning a BAD_REQUEST status, as the action to be performed (upload or publish) is mandatory as per the method logic.

Scenario 2: Successful image upload

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithValidUpload
  Description: This test ensures the method handles a valid image upload correctly, returning a CREATED status when the 'upload' parameter is set to "Upload" and the file is valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid mock MultipartFile with a non-empty original filename and a mock Model.
  Act: Call saveNotes with 'upload' set to "Upload" and a valid MultipartFile.
  Assert: Verify that the response entity has a status of HttpStatus.CREATED.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that when a valid file is provided for upload with the correct action, the method processes the request successfully, indicating that the image has been uploaded, which is signified by the CREATED status.

Scenario 3: Upload with invalid file

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithInvalidFileUpload
  Description: This test checks the scenario where the 'upload' parameter is set to "Upload" but the file is either null or has an empty original filename, which should result in a BAD_REQUEST response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an invalid mock MultipartFile (null or with an empty original filename) and a mock Model.
  Act: Call saveNotes with 'upload' set to "Upload" and an invalid MultipartFile.
  Assert: Verify that the response entity has a status of HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method enforces the requirement of a valid file for the upload operation and returns a BAD_REQUEST status when the file is invalid, thus preventing the upload of empty or non-existent files.

Scenario 4: Successful note publishing

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithValidPublish
  Description: This test verifies that the method correctly handles a request to publish a note, returning a CREATED status when the 'publish' parameter is set to "Publish".
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Model and a String description.
  Act: Call saveNotes with 'publish' set to "Publish" and a valid description.
  Assert: Verify that the response entity has a status of HttpStatus.CREATED.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method processes the request to publish a note successfully, as indicated by the CREATED status, confirming that the note has been saved.

Scenario 5: Invalid action parameter

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithInvalidAction
  Description: This test assesses the method's response when provided with invalid values for both 'upload' and 'publish' parameters, expecting a BAD_REQUEST response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock MultipartFile, a String description, and a mock Model.
  Act: Call saveNotes with 'upload' and 'publish' set to invalid values (not "Upload" or "Publish").
  Assert: Verify that the response entity has a status of HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies invalid action parameters and responds with a BAD_REQUEST status, ensuring that only valid actions ("Upload" or "Publish") are accepted.

Scenario 6: Simultaneous upload and publish parameters

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithBothActionsProvided
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the method when both 'upload' and 'publish' parameters are provided. It is expected to prioritize 'upload' action over 'publish'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid mock MultipartFile with a non-empty original filename, a String description, and a mock Model.
  Act: Call saveNotes with both 'upload' set to "Upload" and 'publish' set to "Publish".
  Assert: Verify that the response entity has a status of HttpStatus.CREATED and that the uploadImage method was called.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method prioritizes the 'upload' action when both actions are specified, as suggested by the method logic, and processes the request accordingly with a CREATED status, implying a successful image upload.
