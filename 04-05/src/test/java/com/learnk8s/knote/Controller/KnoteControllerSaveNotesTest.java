Scenario 1: Valid Upload Request with File and Description

Details:
  TestName: validUploadRequestWithFile
  Description: This test ensures that when a valid file and description are provided with the "Upload" parameter, the method processes the upload correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile to simulate a valid file upload and set the description and upload parameters.
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with the mock file, description, and upload parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has the status code HttpStatus.CREATED.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion verifies the method returns a created status when a valid upload request is made, reflecting successful processing of the upload. This test is significant as it confirms the method's ability to handle file uploads correctly.

Scenario 2: Upload Request with Invalid File

Details:
  TestName: uploadRequestWithInvalidFile
  Description: This test checks the method's response when an upload request is made with an invalid file (e.g., empty filename).
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile with an empty filename and set the description and upload parameters.
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with the mock file, description, and upload parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has the status code HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns a bad request status when an invalid file is provided, ensuring the method validates file input before processing. This test is important for confirming error handling for file validation.

Scenario 3: Valid Publish Request

Details:
  TestName: validPublishRequest
  Description: This test ensures that when a publish request is made with a valid description, the note is saved correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the description and publish parameters, with the publish parameter equal to "Publish".
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with the appropriate parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has the status code HttpStatus.CREATED.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method returns a created status for a valid publish request, indicating the note was saved successfully. This test is crucial for verifying the publish functionality of the method.

Scenario 4: Request without Upload or Publish

Details:
  TestName: requestWithoutUploadOrPublish
  Description: This test verifies that the method returns a bad request status when neither the upload nor publish parameters are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the description parameter without setting upload or publish.
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with just the description parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has the status code HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method enforces the requirement of having either upload or publish parameters. This test is significant for validating the method's adherence to its parameter requirements.

Scenario 5: Request with Both Upload and Publish

Details:
  TestName: requestWithBothUploadAndPublish
  Description: This test case checks the method's behavior when both upload and publish parameters are provided, which is not a defined behavior in the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock a valid file, set the description, and provide both upload and publish parameters.
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with all parameters set.
  Assert: Assert the outcome based on the method's current implementation for this scenario.
Validation:
  This assertion is to verify how the method handles conflicting parameters since the method does not explicitly address this scenario. The significance of this test lies in identifying potential undefined behavior or conflicts in parameter handling.

Scenario 6: Upload Request with Null File

Details:
  TestName: uploadRequestWithNullFile
  Description: This test checks the method's response when a null file is passed in the upload request.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the file parameter to null, the description to a valid string, and the upload parameter to "Upload".
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with the null file, description, and upload parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has the status code HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns a bad request status when a null file is provided for upload, ensuring the method handles null inputs appropriately. This test is important for error handling and input validation.

Scenario 7: Publish Request with Empty Description

Details:
  TestName: publishRequestWithEmptyDescription
  Description: This test determines the method's response when an empty description is provided in the publish request.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the description to an empty string and the publish parameter to "Publish".
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with the empty description and publish parameters.
  Assert: Assert the outcome based on the method's current implementation for this scenario.
Validation:
  The assertion checks the method's handling of empty descriptions in publish requests. The importance of this test is to ensure that descriptions are validated before saving notes and to clarify the expected behavior for empty descriptions.
