ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=saveNotes_584e2e5550

Scenario 1: Missing both upload and publish parameters

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithNoActionSelected
  Description: This test checks the scenario where both 'upload' and 'publish' parameters are missing, which should result in a BAD_REQUEST response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock MultipartFile and a mock Model.
  Act: Call saveNotes with null 'upload' and 'publish' parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the response entity has a status of HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method correctly handles the absence of action parameters by returning a BAD_REQUEST status, as the action to be performed (upload or publish) is mandatory as per the method logic.

Scenario 2: Successful image upload

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithValidUpload
  Description: This test ensures the method handles a valid image upload correctly, returning a CREATED status when the 'upload' parameter is set to "Upload" and the file is valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid mock MultipartFile with a non-empty original filename and a mock Model.
  Act: Call saveNotes with 'upload' set to "Upload" and a valid MultipartFile.
  Assert: Verify that the response entity has a status of HttpStatus.CREATED.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that when a valid file is provided for upload with the correct action, the method processes the request successfully, indicating that the image has been uploaded, which is signified by the CREATED status.

Scenario 3: Upload with invalid file

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithInvalidFileUpload
  Description: This test checks the scenario where the 'upload' parameter is set to "Upload" but the file is either null or has an empty original filename, which should result in a BAD_REQUEST response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an invalid mock MultipartFile (null or with an empty original filename) and a mock Model.
  Act: Call saveNotes with 'upload' set to "Upload" and an invalid MultipartFile.
  Assert: Verify that the response entity has a status of HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method enforces the requirement of a valid file for the upload operation and returns a BAD_REQUEST status when the file is invalid, thus preventing the upload of empty or non-existent files.

Scenario 4: Successful note publishing

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithValidPublish
  Description: This test verifies that the method correctly handles a request to publish a note, returning a CREATED status when the 'publish' parameter is set to "Publish".
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Model and a String description.
  Act: Call saveNotes with 'publish' set to "Publish" and a valid description.
  Assert: Verify that the response entity has a status of HttpStatus.CREATED.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method processes the request to publish a note successfully, as indicated by the CREATED status, confirming that the note has been saved.

Scenario 5: Invalid action parameter

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithInvalidAction
  Description: This test assesses the method's response when provided with invalid values for both 'upload' and 'publish' parameters, expecting a BAD_REQUEST response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock MultipartFile, a String description, and a mock Model.
  Act: Call saveNotes with 'upload' and 'publish' set to invalid values (not "Upload" or "Publish").
  Assert: Verify that the response entity has a status of HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies invalid action parameters and responds with a BAD_REQUEST status, ensuring that only valid actions ("Upload" or "Publish") are accepted.

Scenario 6: Simultaneous upload and publish parameters

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithBothActionsProvided
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the method when both 'upload' and 'publish' parameters are provided. It is expected to prioritize 'upload' action over 'publish'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid mock MultipartFile with a non-empty original filename, a String description, and a mock Model.
  Act: Call saveNotes with both 'upload' set to "Upload" and 'publish' set to "Publish".
  Assert: Verify that the response entity has a status of HttpStatus.CREATED and that the uploadImage method was called.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method prioritizes the 'upload' action when both actions are specified, as suggested by the method logic, and processes the request accordingly with a CREATED status, implying a successful image upload.

The unit test function fails to compile due to two compilation errors related to the `HttpStatusCode` class which cannot be found within the `org.springframework.http` package. 

The first error is a result of the import statement `import org.springframework.http.HttpStatusCode;` which is incorrect because the `HttpStatusCode` class does not exist in the Spring Framework. Instead, the correct class that should be used is `HttpStatus`.

The second error is related to the return type of the `saveNotes` method which uses `HttpStatusCode` instead of the correct `HttpStatus` class.

To resolve these errors, references to `HttpStatusCode` should be replaced with `HttpStatus` in the import statement and in the method's return type. After making these changes, the unit test should be able to compile successfully, assuming there are no other unrelated issues in the codebase.

Additionally, the Maven warnings about the unique dependency issue should be addressed to ensure the stability and predictability of the build, although these warnings are not the cause of the compilation failure. The warning indicates that there are duplicate entries for the `spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb` dependency in the `pom.xml` file with different versions. This should be fixed by ensuring that each dependency is defined only once with the correct version number.

The second error occurs where the test function is attempting to return `ResponseEntity<HttpStatusCode>`. Since `HttpStatusCode` is not a valid type, the Java compiler cannot resolve it. The correct return type should be `ResponseEntity<HttpStatus>`.

In summary, the test is failing to compile due to an incorrect reference to a non-existent `HttpStatusCode` class. The correct class that should be used is `HttpStatus` from the `org.springframework.http` package. The import statement and the return type in the test function need to be corrected to use `HttpStatus` instead of `HttpStatusCode`.

The first error is a result of the import statement `import org.springframework.http.HttpStatusCode;` which is incorrect because the `HttpStatusCode` class does not exist in the Spring Framework. The correct class that should be used is `HttpStatus`, which is the enum provided by Spring that contains all the standard HTTP status codes.

The second error occurs in the method signature of the `saveNotes` function where `HttpStatusCode` is used as the return type for the `ResponseEntity`. This should also be changed to `HttpStatus`.

To resolve these compilation errors, you need to replace `HttpStatusCode` with `HttpStatus` in both the import statement and the method signature of the `saveNotes` function. Once the correct class is used, the unit test should be able to compile and run. If there are any logic errors in the test after compilation, they would need to be debugged separately.
public void saveNotesWithValidUpload() throws Exception {
        when(file.getOriginalFilename()).thenReturn("image.png");
        ResponseEntity<HttpStatus> response = knoteController.saveNotes(file, "description", null, "Upload", model);

The first error is a result of the import statement `import org.springframework.http.HttpStatusCode;` which is incorrect or the class `HttpStatusCode` doesn't exist in the `org.springframework.http` package. 

The second error occurs where the method `saveNotes` is supposed to return a `ResponseEntity<HttpStatusCode>`. Since the `HttpStatusCode` symbol cannot be found, the return type of the method is not recognized by the compiler.

The correct class that should be used is `HttpStatus`, not `HttpStatusCode`. `HttpStatus` is the enum provided by Spring Framework that contains the standard HTTP status codes. The method signature and any return statements involving `HttpStatusCode` should be corrected to use `HttpStatus` instead.

Additionally, the test function itself is incorrectly labeled with `@PostMapping` annotation, which is not appropriate for a test method but rather for a controller method. This will not cause a compilation error but is a logical inconsistency in the context of a unit test. The test method should not have Spring MVC annotations like `@PostMapping`, `@RequestParam`, or take `Model` as a parameter. Instead, it should use a test framework's annotations and methods to mock the behavior of the web environment and validate the controller's behavior.

The Maven warnings about the dependency in the `pom.xml` file indicate that there is a duplicate entry for the `spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb` dependency with different versions. While this does not directly affect the compilation of the test function, it could lead to unexpected runtime behavior and should be resolved for a stable build.
public void saveNotesWithInvalidFileUpload() throws Exception {
        when(file.getOriginalFilename()).thenReturn("");
        ResponseEntity<HttpStatus> response = knoteController.saveNotes(file, "description", null, "Upload", model);

The unit test function fails to compile due to two compilation errors related to the `HttpStatusCode` class which cannot be found within the `org.springframework.http` package. 

The first error is a result of the import statement failing to locate the `HttpStatusCode` class, which is not a standard class in the `org.springframework.http` package. The correct class that should be used is `HttpStatus`, which is the standard class provided by the Spring framework for representing HTTP status codes.

The second error occurs where the method `saveNotes` is attempting to return a `ResponseEntity<HttpStatusCode>`. Since there is no `HttpStatusCode` class available, it again should be `ResponseEntity<HttpStatus>`.

To resolve these errors, the references to `HttpStatusCode` should be replaced with `HttpStatus`, which is the correct class that represents HTTP status codes in the Spring framework. Once these changes are made, the test function should be able to compile successfully, assuming there are no other unrelated errors. 

Please note that the provided test function seems to be a copy of the business logic method rather than an actual test function. In a typical unit test, we would expect to see assertions being made to verify the behavior of the `saveNotes` method under various conditions. However, no such assertions or test annotations are present in the given code snippet.
public void saveNotesWithValidPublish() throws Exception {
		ResponseEntity<HttpStatus> response = knoteController.saveNotes(file, "description", "Publish", null, model);
		assertEquals(HttpStatus.CREATED, response.getBody());

The method signature and any return statements involving `HttpStatusCode` should be corrected to use `HttpStatus` instead.

Additionally, the test function itself is incorrectly labeled with `@PostMapping` which is an annotation to be used in the controller class, not in test classes. However, since the error logs provided are related to the compilation errors and not the test execution, this misuse of the annotation does not appear in the error log.

In summary, to fix the compilation errors, one must:

1. Replace `HttpStatusCode` with `HttpStatus` in the import statement and in the method return type.
2. Remove the `@PostMapping` annotation from the test method as it is not applicable for unit tests.

Once these issues are corrected, the code should compile successfully, and the unit test can be run to determine if there are any logical errors or failed assertions within the test.
public void saveNotesWithInvalidAction() throws Exception {
		ResponseEntity<HttpStatus> response = knoteController.saveNotes(file, "description", "invalid", "invalid",

The unit test function fails to compile due to two compilation errors related to the `HttpStatusCode` class which appears to be unrecognized within the context of the Spring Framework and the `KnoteController` class.

The specific errors are as follows:

1. The `HttpStatusCode` class cannot be found within the `org.springframework.http` package. This is likely because there is no class by that name within the Spring Framework. The correct class that should be used is `HttpStatus`.

2. Similarly, within the `KnoteController` class, the `HttpStatusCode` symbol cannot be found. This again suggests that the `HttpStatusCode` class is being referenced incorrectly.

To resolve the compilation errors, the `HttpStatusCode` references should be replaced with `HttpStatus`, which is the correct class provided by the Spring Framework to represent HTTP status codes.

Additionally, the warnings in the Maven project build suggest that there is a duplicate dependency declaration for `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb` with unspecified versions. This should be resolved by ensuring that each dependency is declared only once with a specific version number to maintain build stability.
public void saveNotesWithBothActionsProvided() throws Exception {
        when(file.getOriginalFilename()).thenReturn("image.png");
        ResponseEntity<HttpStatus> response = knoteController.saveNotes(file, "description", "Publish", "Upload", model);
