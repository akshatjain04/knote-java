Scenario 1: Missing both publish and upload parameters

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithMissingPublishAndUploadParams
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the saveNotes method when neither publish nor upload parameters are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock MultipartFile object and a Model instance.
  Act: Call saveNotes with the mock file, a description, and null values for publish and upload.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a BAD_REQUEST status.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the correct HttpStatus is returned when required parameters are missing. This test is significant as it validates the method's error handling when not all parameters are provided.

Scenario 2: Valid upload operation with correct parameters

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithValidUpload
  Description: This test checks if the saveNotes method successfully uploads an image when provided with correct parameters and "Upload" action.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock MultipartFile object with a non-empty original filename and a Model instance.
  Act: Call saveNotes with the mock file, a description, and "Upload" as the upload parameter.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a CREATED status.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the method processes the upload correctly and returns the expected status. It's important to confirm that the application handles file uploads as intended.

Scenario 3: Attempt to upload with an empty file

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithEmptyFileUpload
  Description: This test checks the saveNotes method's response when an attempt to upload an empty file is made.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock MultipartFile object with an empty original filename and a Model instance.
  Act: Call saveNotes with the mock empty file, a description, and "Upload" as the upload parameter.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a BAD_REQUEST status.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method rejects empty files and provides the correct HttpStatus, which is crucial for preventing invalid file uploads.

Scenario 4: Valid publish operation with correct parameters

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithValidPublish
  Description: This test ensures that the saveNotes method can successfully save a note when the "Publish" action is requested.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Model instance and set up any required data for the publish operation.
  Act: Call saveNotes with a description, "Publish" as the publish parameter, and null for the upload parameter.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has a CREATED status.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method handles note publishing correctly and returns the expected HttpStatus. This test is significant for confirming that the note-saving functionality works as intended.

Scenario 5: Both publish and upload parameters provided

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithBothPublishAndUploadParams
  Description: This test examines the saveNotes method's response when both publish and upload parameters are provided, which is not a typical use case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock MultipartFile object, a Model instance, and specify both "Publish" and "Upload" parameters.
  Act: Call saveNotes with the mock file, a description, and both parameters set to non-null values.
  Assert: The expected behavior is not clearly defined in the provided method, so this test may either look for a BAD_REQUEST or CREATED status based on the actual application logic.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for consistent behavior when conflicting parameters are provided. This scenario is important to clarify how the method should behave in this situation and to ensure that there is no ambiguity in the processing logic.

	// Comment: The saveNotes method in KnoteController should specify the expected
	// behavior when both 'publish' and 'upload' parameters are provided.
	// Currently, this test case assumes that 'publish' is prioritized, but this may not
	// be the intended behavior.
	// Suggested enhancement: Update the saveNotes method to explicitly handle the case
	// when both 'publish' and 'upload' are provided, either by returning an error or by
	// defining a priority.
