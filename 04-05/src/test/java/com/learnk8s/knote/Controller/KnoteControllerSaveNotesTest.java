Scenario 1: Missing both upload and publish parameters

Details:
  TestName: testSaveNotesWithMissingUploadAndPublish
  Description: This test ensures that when both upload and publish parameters are missing, the method returns a BAD_REQUEST status code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile and Model.
  Act: Call the saveNotes method without the upload and publish parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity contains the BAD_REQUEST status code.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method behaves correctly when required parameters are not provided. The BAD_REQUEST status is expected because the business logic dictates that either "Upload" or "Publish" must be specified.

Scenario 2: Upload image with valid file and description

Details:
  TestName: testSaveNotesWithValidUpload
  Description: This test checks whether the method can handle a valid file upload with the correct description and upload parameter set to "Upload".
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock MultipartFile with a valid original filename and a non-empty description string. Mock the Model.
  Act: Call the saveNotes method with the valid file, description, and upload parameter set to "Upload".
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity contains the CREATED status code.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the uploadImage method is called with the correct parameters and that the method should return a CREATED status upon successful upload. This test is significant for verifying the file upload functionality.

Scenario 3: Upload image with invalid file

Details:
  TestName: testSaveNotesWithInvalidFileUpload
  Description: This test ensures that when an invalid file (e.g., empty or null filename) is provided for upload, the method returns a BAD_REQUEST status code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock an invalid MultipartFile (with a null or empty filename) and a valid description. Mock the Model.
  Act: Call the saveNotes method with the invalid file and set upload parameter to "Upload".
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity contains the BAD_REQUEST status code.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method responds with a BAD_REQUEST status when the file is invalid. This test is important for ensuring robust error handling in the file upload process.

Scenario 4: Publish note with valid description

Details:
  TestName: testSaveNotesWithValidPublish
  Description: This test verifies that the method correctly handles note publishing with a valid description when the publish parameter is set to "Publish".
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile and provide a non-empty description. Mock the Model.
  Act: Call the saveNotes method with a valid description and the publish parameter set to "Publish".
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity contains the CREATED status code.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the saveNote method is called and the method should return a CREATED status upon successful note publishing. This test confirms the publish functionality is working as expected.

Scenario 5: Invalid case with both upload and publish parameters provided

Details:
  TestName: testSaveNotesWithBothUploadAndPublish
  Description: This test checks the method's behavior when both upload and publish parameters are provided, which is an invalid case according to the business logic.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile with a valid file, provide a non-empty description, and mock the Model.
  Act: Call the saveNotes method with both upload and publish parameters set.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity contains the BAD_REQUEST status code.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method should not allow both parameters to be set simultaneously and should return a BAD_REQUEST status. This test is crucial for validating that the method enforces the expected usage contract.

Scenario 6: Publish note without description

Details:
  TestName: testSaveNotesWithPublishAndNoDescription
  Description: This test ensures that if the publish parameter is provided but the description is empty or null, the method returns a BAD_REQUEST status code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile and provide an empty or null description. Mock the Model.
  Act: Call the saveNotes method with an empty or null description and the publish parameter set to "Publish".
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity contains the BAD_REQUEST status code.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method should not allow publishing a note without a description and should return a BAD_REQUEST status. This test is important for ensuring that notes are not published without the essential information.

	/*
The compilation errors indicate that there is a type mismatch in the `ResponseEntity` generic type. The method signature of the `saveNotes` function specifies a return type of `ResponseEntity<HttpStatusCode>`, but in multiple instances within the test, there is an attempt to convert this to `ResponseEntity<HttpStatus>`. The `HttpStatus` class is typically used within the `ResponseEntity` to indicate the HTTP status code of the response, not as a generic type parameter.

To resolve these errors, the generic type parameter in the return type of the `saveNotes` method should be corrected to `ResponseEntity<HttpStatus>`. This will ensure that the method returns a `ResponseEntity` object with the correct generic type, which is expected to be an enumeration of HTTP status codes (`HttpStatus`), not `HttpStatusCode` (which appears to be an invalid type in this context).

The test is failing to compile because of this incorrect use of generic types. Once the return type is corrected to `ResponseEntity<HttpStatus>`, the test should compile successfully, assuming there are no other unrelated errors.

It's also worth noting that the warnings at the beginning of the error log about duplicate dependencies in the Maven POM file should be addressed to ensure the stability and predictability of the build, though they are not the cause of the compilation failure.

The compilation errors indicate that there is a type mismatch in the test function related to the `ResponseEntity` generic type. The test function is expecting a `ResponseEntity<HttpStatusCode>`, but the actual method signature returns a `ResponseEntity<HttpStatus>`. The `HttpStatusCode` is not a valid type for the generic `ResponseEntity` in the Spring framework; instead, `HttpStatus` should be used.

The errors are consistently pointing out that the return type of the `saveNotes` method in the test is incorrect. The method should be returning `ResponseEntity<HttpStatus>` instead of `ResponseEntity<HttpStatusCode>`. `HttpStatus` is the enum provided by Spring that contains all the standard HTTP status codes, and that's what should be used here.

To resolve these errors, the test method signatures should be corrected to match the expected return type of `ResponseEntity<HttpStatus>`. This means that wherever `ResponseEntity<HttpStatusCode>` is used, it should be replaced with `ResponseEntity<HttpStatus>`.

The test cases are failing to compile because of this type mismatch, and once the return types are corrected to use `HttpStatus`, the tests should compile successfully. It's important to ensure that the return types in both the business logic method and the test methods are consistent and use the correct types provided by the Spring framework.
public void testSaveNotesWithValidUpload() throws Exception {

The errors are consistently pointing out that the return type of the `saveNotes` method in the test function is incorrectly specified as `ResponseEntity<HttpStatusCode>` when it should be `ResponseEntity<HttpStatus>`.

To resolve these errors, the test function should be corrected to use `ResponseEntity<HttpStatus>` as the return type instead of `ResponseEntity<HttpStatusCode>`. Once this change is made, the compilation errors should be resolved, allowing the test to compile and run successfully.

Additionally, there is a Maven warning about a dependency conflict for `spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb` with unspecified versions. This is not directly related to the compilation error but should be addressed to ensure a stable build and prevent potential runtime issues. The project's `pom.xml` file should be checked to ensure that each dependency is declared with a unique combination of `groupId`, `artifactId`, and `version`.
public void testSaveNotesWithInvalidFileUpload() throws Exception {

The compilation errors indicate that there is a type mismatch in the test function where `ResponseEntity<HttpStatusCode>` is being used, but the expected type is `ResponseEntity<HttpStatus>`. The `HttpStatusCode` is likely not a valid type for the parameterized type of `ResponseEntity` in the Spring framework. Instead, the correct type should be `HttpStatus`, which is an enum provided by the Spring framework to represent HTTP status codes.

The error messages:

```
[ERROR] ... incompatible types: org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity<org.springframework.http.HttpStatusCode> cannot be converted to org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity<org.springframework.http.HttpStatus>
```

indicate that wherever the test is expecting a `ResponseEntity<HttpStatus>`, a `ResponseEntity<HttpStatusCode>` is being provided, which is not correct.

To resolve these errors, the test method signatures should be corrected to use `ResponseEntity<HttpStatus>` instead of `ResponseEntity<HttpStatusCode>`. This change should be made in the test code where the `ResponseEntity` object is being created or returned.

In summary, the test is failing to compile because the incorrect type is being used with `ResponseEntity`. The test should use `HttpStatus` as the parameterized type, which is the correct type expected by the Spring framework when dealing with HTTP responses and status codes.
public void testSaveNotesWithValidPublish() throws Exception {
		ResponseEntity<HttpStatus> response = knoteController.saveNotes(file, "A valid description", "Publish", null,
				model);
		assertEquals(HttpStatus.CREATED, response.getBody());

The test function is expecting a `ResponseEntity<HttpStatusCode>`, but the actual method is returning a `ResponseEntity<HttpStatus>`. The `HttpStatusCode` is not a valid type for the generic `ResponseEntity` in the Spring framework; instead, `HttpStatus` should be used.

The errors such as:

```
[ERROR] incompatible types: org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity<org.springframework.http.HttpStatusCode> cannot be converted to org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity<org.springframework.http.HttpStatus>
```

are occurring because `HttpStatusCode` is not a recognized type that can be used with `ResponseEntity`. The correct type should be `HttpStatus`, which is an enum provided by the Spring framework representing HTTP status codes.

To fix these errors, the test method signatures and any relevant code that uses `ResponseEntity<HttpStatusCode>` should be changed to use `ResponseEntity<HttpStatus>` instead. This will resolve the type mismatch and allow the code to compile.

In addition, there is a Maven warning about a duplicated dependency declaration in the `pom.xml` file:

```
[WARNING] 'dependencies.dependency.(groupId:artifactId:type:classifier)' must be unique: org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb:jar -> version (?) vs 3.0.6 @ line 116, column 17
```

This warning suggests that there are two entries for the `spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb` dependency with different versions, which could cause instability in the build. This should be resolved by removing the duplicate entry and keeping only one version of the dependency.

The errors need to be fixed by:

- Changing `HttpStatusCode` to `HttpStatus` in the ResponseEntity generic type within the test method and any other places where it is used incorrectly.
- Resolving the duplicated dependency declaration in the `pom.xml` file.

Once these changes are made, the test should compile and run successfully, assuming there are no other issues with the business logic or other parts of the code.
public void testSaveNotesWithBothUploadAndPublish() throws Exception {
        when(file.getOriginalFilename()).thenReturn("valid_filename.jpg");

The compilation errors indicate that there is a type mismatch in the test function. Specifically, the test function is attempting to return a `ResponseEntity<HttpStatusCode>` object where a `ResponseEntity<HttpStatus>` is expected. `HttpStatus` is an enum representing HTTP status codes, while `HttpStatusCode` is not a standard type recognized in the context of `ResponseEntity` in Spring.

The test cases are failing to compile because the generic type parameter provided to the `ResponseEntity` in the test function is incorrect. In the Spring framework, the `ResponseEntity` class is typically parameterized with the type of the body it will contain, and not with `HttpStatus` or `HttpStatusCode`. When the status code is set in the `ResponseEntity`, it should be done using the appropriate `HttpStatus` enum constant, and the body type should be specified as the generic parameter if needed.

To fix the test function, the return type of the method signatures in the test cases should be corrected to use `ResponseEntity<?>` (or another appropriate type for the body if a body is being returned) instead of `ResponseEntity<HttpStatusCode>`. Additionally, the method calls that create `ResponseEntity` objects should use `ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.X).build()` or `ResponseEntity.ok().body(someBody)` patterns to correctly construct the response entity with the intended HTTP status code.

The warning about the duplicated dependency is not directly related to the test failures but should be addressed to ensure a stable build. It indicates that there are two entries for the `spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb` dependency in the `pom.xml` file, possibly with different versions. This needs to be resolved by removing the duplicate entry or consolidating them into one with the correct version.

		ResponseEntity<HttpStatus> response = knoteController.saveNotes(file, "", "Publish", null, model);
		assertEquals(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST, response.getBody());
