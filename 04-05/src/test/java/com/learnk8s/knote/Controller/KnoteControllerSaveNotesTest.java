Scenario 1: Valid Upload Request with File and Description

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithValidUpload
  Description: This test ensures that when a valid file and description are provided with the "Upload" parameter, the method processes the upload correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile to simulate a valid file upload and set the description and upload parameters.
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with the mock file, description, and upload parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has the status code HttpStatus.CREATED.
Validation:
  Clarify that the file upload process is handled correctly when valid inputs are provided, and the method should return a CREATED status as a successful operation.
  The significance is to confirm that the upload functionality works as expected and handles the file upload process properly.

Scenario 2: Upload Request with Missing File

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithMissingFile
  Description: This test verifies that the method returns a BAD_REQUEST status when the file is missing in the upload request.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a request with a null MultipartFile, a valid description, and the upload parameter set to "Upload".
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with null for the file parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has the status code HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  Clarify that the method should validate the presence of a file and return a BAD_REQUEST status when the file is missing.
  This test is significant because it checks the method's ability to handle invalid input and return an appropriate error response.

Scenario 3: Publish Request with Description

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithValidPublish
  Description: This test checks if the method saves the note correctly when the "Publish" parameter is provided along with a description.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the publish parameter to "Publish" and provide a valid description.
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with the publish and description parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has the status code HttpStatus.CREATED.
Validation:
  Clarify that the method should handle the publish action correctly when valid inputs are provided and return a CREATED status.
  The significance of this test is to ensure that the method supports the publishing of notes correctly.

Scenario 4: Invalid Request with Neither Upload nor Publish

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithMissingAction
  Description: This scenario tests the method's response when neither the "Upload" nor the "Publish" parameters are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a request without the upload and publish parameters, but with a valid file and description.
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method without the upload and publish parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has the status code HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  Clarify that the method should require either the "Upload" or "Publish" parameter and return a BAD_REQUEST status when neither is provided.
  This test is significant as it validates the method's requirement for an action to be specified.

Scenario 5: Valid Request with Both Upload and Publish

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithBothActions
  Description: This test ensures that the method can handle a request where both "Upload" and "Publish" parameters are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile, set a valid description, and provide both upload and publish parameters set to their respective actions.
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with both upload and publish parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the ResponseEntity returned has the status code HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  Clarify that the method should not allow both "Upload" and "Publish" actions in the same request and should return a BAD_REQUEST status.
  The significance of this test is to ensure that the method enforces the rule that only one action can be specified per request.
