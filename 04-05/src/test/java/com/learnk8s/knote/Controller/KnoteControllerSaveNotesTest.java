Scenario 1: Missing both upload and publish parameters

Details:
  TestName: testSaveNotesWithMissingUploadAndPublish
  Description: This test ensures that when both upload and publish parameters are missing, the method returns a BAD_REQUEST status code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile and Model.
  Act: Call the saveNotes method without the upload and publish parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity contains the BAD_REQUEST status code.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method behaves correctly when required parameters are not provided. The BAD_REQUEST status is expected because the business logic dictates that either "Upload" or "Publish" must be specified.

Scenario 2: Upload image with valid file and description

Details:
  TestName: testSaveNotesWithValidUpload
  Description: This test checks whether the method can handle a valid file upload with the correct description and upload parameter set to "Upload".
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock MultipartFile with a valid original filename and a non-empty description string. Mock the Model.
  Act: Call the saveNotes method with the valid file, description, and upload parameter set to "Upload".
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity contains the CREATED status code.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the uploadImage method is called with the correct parameters and that the method should return a CREATED status upon successful upload. This test is significant for verifying the file upload functionality.

Scenario 3: Upload image with invalid file

Details:
  TestName: testSaveNotesWithInvalidFileUpload
  Description: This test ensures that when an invalid file (e.g., empty or null filename) is provided for upload, the method returns a BAD_REQUEST status code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock an invalid MultipartFile (with a null or empty filename) and a valid description. Mock the Model.
  Act: Call the saveNotes method with the invalid file and set upload parameter to "Upload".
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity contains the BAD_REQUEST status code.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method responds with a BAD_REQUEST status when the file is invalid. This test is important for ensuring robust error handling in the file upload process.

Scenario 4: Publish note with valid description

Details:
  TestName: testSaveNotesWithValidPublish
  Description: This test verifies that the method correctly handles note publishing with a valid description when the publish parameter is set to "Publish".
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile and provide a non-empty description. Mock the Model.
  Act: Call the saveNotes method with a valid description and the publish parameter set to "Publish".
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity contains the CREATED status code.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the saveNote method is called and the method should return a CREATED status upon successful note publishing. This test confirms the publish functionality is working as expected.

Scenario 5: Invalid case with both upload and publish parameters provided

Details:
  TestName: testSaveNotesWithBothUploadAndPublish
  Description: This test checks the method's behavior when both upload and publish parameters are provided, which is an invalid case according to the business logic.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile with a valid file, provide a non-empty description, and mock the Model.
  Act: Call the saveNotes method with both upload and publish parameters set.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity contains the BAD_REQUEST status code.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method should not allow both parameters to be set simultaneously and should return a BAD_REQUEST status. This test is crucial for validating that the method enforces the expected usage contract.

Scenario 6: Publish note without description

Details:
  TestName: testSaveNotesWithPublishAndNoDescription
  Description: This test ensures that if the publish parameter is provided but the description is empty or null, the method returns a BAD_REQUEST status code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile and provide an empty or null description. Mock the Model.
  Act: Call the saveNotes method with an empty or null description and the publish parameter set to "Publish".
  Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity contains the BAD_REQUEST status code.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method should not allow publishing a note without a description and should return a BAD_REQUEST status. This test is important for ensuring that notes are not published without the essential information.
