Scenario 1: Missing both upload and publish parameters

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithNoActionSelected
  Description: This test checks the scenario where both 'upload' and 'publish' parameters are missing, which should result in a BAD_REQUEST response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock MultipartFile and a mock Model.
  Act: Call saveNotes with null 'upload' and 'publish' parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the response entity has a status of HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns a BAD_REQUEST when neither upload nor publish options are specified, as per the method's requirement to have at least one of them.
  This test is significant because it ensures that the application handles cases where required parameters are not provided by the client.

Scenario 2: Valid upload with a non-empty file

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithValidUpload
  Description: This test ensures that when a valid file is uploaded with the 'upload' parameter set to "Upload", the method processes the file and returns a CREATED status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock MultipartFile with a non-empty original filename and a mock Model.
  Act: Call saveNotes with 'upload' set to "Upload" and a valid file.
  Assert: Verify that the response entity has a status of HttpStatus.CREATED.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the method successfully uploads a valid file and responds with the CREATED status. This is important to confirm that the upload functionality works as expected.

Scenario 3: Invalid upload with an empty file

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithEmptyFileUpload
  Description: This test checks the scenario where an empty file is provided for upload, which should result in a BAD_REQUEST response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock MultipartFile with an empty original filename and a mock Model.
  Act: Call saveNotes with 'upload' set to "Upload" and an empty file.
  Assert: Verify that the response entity has a status of HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method returns a BAD_REQUEST when an empty file is uploaded, as the method requires a non-empty file for the upload operation.
  This test is significant as it validates that the application prevents users from uploading empty files, which could lead to unnecessary resource usage or data inconsistency.

Scenario 4: Valid publish with a non-empty description

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithValidPublish
  Description: This test confirms that when a non-empty description is provided with the 'publish' parameter set to "Publish", the method saves the note and returns a CREATED status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Model and a non-empty description string.
  Act: Call saveNotes with 'publish' set to "Publish" and a valid description.
  Assert: Verify that the response entity has a status of HttpStatus.CREATED.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the method saves the note with a valid description and responds with the CREATED status, confirming that the publish functionality is working correctly.

Scenario 5: Publish with an empty description

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithEmptyDescriptionPublish
  Description: This test checks the scenario where an empty description is provided for publishing, which should be handled correctly by the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Model and an empty description string.
  Act: Call saveNotes with 'publish' set to "Publish" and an empty description.
  Assert: Verify the appropriate behavior of the method (the test may need to be adjusted based on actual method implementation for handling empty descriptions).
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify the method's behavior when an empty description is provided for publishing. The significance of this test depends on the business logic regarding empty descriptions, which is not clear from the provided method.

Scenario 6: Both upload and publish parameters provided

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithBothActionsSelected
  Description: This test checks the scenario where both 'upload' and 'publish' parameters are provided, which should be handled correctly by the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock MultipartFile, a mock Model, and set both 'upload' and 'publish' parameters.
  Act: Call saveNotes with both 'upload' and 'publish' parameters provided.
  Assert: Verify the appropriate behavior of the method (the test may need to be adjusted based on actual method implementation for handling both parameters).
Validation:
  The assertion verifies how the method behaves when both action parameters are provided. The test is significant to ensure that the method handles conflicting parameters according to the application's requirements.

These scenarios cover a range of inputs and edge cases for the saveNotes method, ensuring that the method behaves correctly under various conditions.
