Scenario 1: Missing both upload and publish parameters

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithNoActionSelected
  Description: This test checks the scenario where both 'upload' and 'publish' parameters are missing, which should result in a BAD_REQUEST response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock MultipartFile and a mock Model.
  Act: Call saveNotes with null 'upload' and 'publish' parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the response entity has a status of HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns a BAD_REQUEST when neither action is specified, as the method logic dictates that one of them must be provided. This test ensures that the controller rejects incomplete requests.

Scenario 2: Valid upload request with non-empty file

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithValidUpload
  Description: This test ensures that when a valid file is uploaded with the 'upload' parameter set to "Upload", the uploadImage method is called and a CREATED response is returned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock MultipartFile with a valid original filename and a mock Model.
  Act: Call saveNotes with 'upload' set to "Upload" and a valid file.
  Assert: Verify that the uploadImage method is called and the response entity has a status of HttpStatus.CREATED.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the controller processes valid upload requests correctly and returns the expected CREATED status. This test validates the upload functionality of the controller.

Scenario 3: Upload request with empty file

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithEmptyFileUpload
  Description: This test checks the behavior when an empty file is provided for upload, which should yield a BAD_REQUEST response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock MultipartFile with an empty original filename and a mock Model.
  Act: Call saveNotes with 'upload' set to "Upload" and an empty file.
  Assert: Verify that the response entity has a status of HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the method returns a BAD_REQUEST when an empty file is uploaded, as per the method's error handling. This test ensures that the controller does not accept empty files for upload.

Scenario 4: Valid publish request

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithValidPublish
  Description: This test ensures that when a description is provided with the 'publish' parameter set to "Publish", the saveNote method is called and a CREATED response is returned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Model and a String description.
  Act: Call saveNotes with 'publish' set to "Publish" and a valid description.
  Assert: Verify that the saveNote method is called and the response entity has a status of HttpStatus.CREATED.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the controller processes valid publish requests correctly and returns the expected CREATED status. This test validates the publish functionality of the controller.

Scenario 5: Both upload and publish parameters provided

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithBothActionsProvided
  Description: This test checks the behavior when both 'upload' and 'publish' parameters are provided, which is not explicitly handled by the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create mock MultipartFile, String description, mock Model, and set both 'upload' and 'publish' parameters.
  Act: Call saveNotes with both 'upload' and 'publish' parameters set.
  Assert: Verify the behavior of the method (either an error or one of the actions takes precedence).
Validation:
  The assertion needs to clarify what is expected when both parameters are provided. Since the method does not explicitly handle this case, the significance of the test is to define and verify the intended behavior for such requests.
