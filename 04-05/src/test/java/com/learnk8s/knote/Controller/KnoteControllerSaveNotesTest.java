Scenario 1: Valid Upload with Correct File and Description

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithValidUpload
  Description: This test ensures that when a valid file and description are provided with the "Upload" parameter set to "Upload", the image is uploaded successfully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile to represent a valid file with an original filename. Provide a non-empty description and set the "upload" parameter to "Upload".
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with the mocked file, description, and parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has the status code HttpStatus.CREATED.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion aims to verify the successful upload of a valid image file. The significance of the test is to confirm that the method correctly processes valid upload requests.

Scenario 2: Upload with Null File

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithNullFileUpload
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the saveNotes method when a null file is provided for upload.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the MultipartFile to null, provide a non-empty description, and set the "upload" parameter to "Upload".
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with the null file, description, and parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has the status code HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion aims to verify the method's error handling when a null file is provided. The significance of the test is to ensure that the method does not process uploads when the file is null.

Scenario 3: Upload with Empty Filename

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithEmptyFilenameUpload
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the saveNotes method when the file has an empty original filename.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the MultipartFile to have an empty original filename. Provide a non-empty description and set the "upload" parameter to "Upload".
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with the mocked file, description, and parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has the status code HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion aims to verify the method's error handling when an empty filename is provided. The significance of the test is to ensure that the method does not process uploads with invalid file names.

Scenario 4: Valid Publish with Description

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithValidPublish
  Description: This test ensures that when a non-empty description is provided with the "Publish" parameter set to "Publish", the note is saved successfully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a non-empty description and set the "publish" parameter to "Publish".
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with the description and parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has the status code HttpStatus.CREATED.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion aims to verify the successful saving of a note. The significance of the test is to confirm that the method correctly processes valid publish requests.

Scenario 5: Neither Upload nor Publish Specified

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithNoActionSpecified
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the saveNotes method when neither "Upload" nor "Publish" parameters are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a non-empty description and ensure that both "upload" and "publish" parameters are null.
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with the description and parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has the status code HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion aims to verify the method's error handling when no action is specified. The significance of the test is to ensure that the method requires either an "Upload" or "Publish" action to be specified.

Scenario 6: Both Upload and Publish Specified

Details:
  TestName: saveNotesWithBothActionsSpecified
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the saveNotes method when both "Upload" and "Publish" parameters are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a non-empty description, set "upload" parameter to "Upload", and "publish" parameter to "Publish".
  Act: Invoke the saveNotes method with the description and parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity returned has the status code HttpStatus.CREATED and confirm the appropriate action was taken (either upload or publish).
Validation:
  Clarify that the assertion aims to verify the method's behavior when conflicting actions are specified. The significance of the test is to ensure that the method can handle cases where both actions are provided, possibly prioritizing one over the other.
